# User Management Application

## Application Description

This User Management Application is a React-based web application designed to manage and display user information. It allows users to input their first name, last name, email, and a message through a form. The application uses Redux for state management, ensuring a seamless user experience. The form includes validation features, ensuring that all fields are filled out correctly before submission.

Once submitted, the user information is stored in a Redux store. The application also includes a User List component that displays the list of users stored in the Redux store. This makes it easy to view all the users who have submitted their information through the form. The application is built with scalability and maintainability in mind, making it easy to add additional features such as editing and deleting users.
